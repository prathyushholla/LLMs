## Hugging Face API Integrations with LangChain

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks designed to demonstrate the integration of Hugging Face's API endpoints with LangChain for language model applications. Each notebook focuses on different aspects of using Hugging Face models, such as making basic API calls and integrating memory to enhance interactions with language models.

## Repository Contents

### 1. Langchain_Huggingface.ipynb
This notebook serves as an introduction to connecting Hugging Face models with LangChain. It demonstrates:
- Setting up and using Hugging Face API endpoints.
- Making API calls to load models from Hugging Face using the `HFEndpoint`.
- Basic use of the `HuggingFacePipeline` to handle pipeline-based model loading.

### 2. IntegratingMemoryUsingHFendpoint.ipynb
This notebook builds on the basic API integration, exploring memory integration with Hugging Face language models. It covers:
- Setting up Hugging Face API endpoints for use in memory-integrated applications.
- Integrating memory into interactions with language models using LangChain.
- Example workflows where memory enhances user interactions with the models.
